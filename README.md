# PrivacyVisionAI
PrivacyVisionAI is an innovative software solution dedicated to enhancing privacy and security within images through the use of artificial intelligence.
My personal thesis work concerns AI using the following technologies:
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 
- pre-trained model for OCR via Roboflow API
- OpenCV library for image processing
- Gradio API for GUI development
